# 🎬 Movie Rating Analysis – Data Science Project

This project explores movie ratings using Python-based data analysis and visualization.  
It demonstrates the core foundations of applied machine learning: data loading, cleaning, exploratory analysis, and insights extraction — suitable as a supporting ML project for internships.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

- Loaded and cleaned raw movie rating data  
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand trends  
- Visualized rating distributions and top-rated movies  
- Identified patterns based on genres, votes, and popularity  
- Created summary insights from data-driven observations  
- Organized the project using a clean ML folder structure

This was an early ML project built for learning fundamentals.
